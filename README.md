## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

I learned more about HTML semantic elememts



### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) - This helped me for choosing the right semantic element to be a container. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [htmlreference.io](https://htmlreference.io/semantic/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the usage of the semantic elements. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
